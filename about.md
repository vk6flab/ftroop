This is the website associated with the weekly amateur radio net "F-troop"

### What is F-troop?

This is a weekly net that runs for an hour on Saturday morning from 0:00 UTC. It's a place where new and returning amateurs can get together, ask questions, meet others and start the process of getting on air and making noise.

### Credits

F-troop has been running since 12 June 2011 and is the brainchild of Meg (previously VK6LUX) and Onno VK6FLAB. It was inspired by a net in Melbourne that was reportedly also called F-troop, but neither Meg or Onno have ever managed to find any other than cursory record of it.

This weekly net is made possible with the efforts of several groups and individuals who connect to the growing network of nodes and who maintain local repeaters and internet links.
